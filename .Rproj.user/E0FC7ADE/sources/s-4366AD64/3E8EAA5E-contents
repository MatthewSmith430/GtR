# GtR
This package provides a set of functions to search for UK research council funded projects from [Gateway to Research.](https://gtr.ukri.org/)

The package can be installed using the following:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("MatthewSmith430/GtR")
library(GtR)
```

*Please note that the README is incomplete and will be updated soon*

## Project Search 
You can search for projects associated with a search term- in the following example I will search for prjects associated with `social network analysis`

```{r sna_search,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(GtR)
library(kableExtra)


SNA_projects<-gtr_project_search("social network analysis")


kable(SNA_projects[1:3,])%>%
  kable_styling() 
```

## Extracting Project infromation 
The following functions extract information for projects. 

### Organisations
The first function extract information on the projects, and lists all of the organisational collaborators, including both academic and non academic organisations. 

This is done for an example project: 
```{r org_ex,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(GtR)
library(pander)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
##Example URL
url<-"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=G0501806"

##Taking out the abstract text from the data - as this is quite long
##Therefore this means the table is easier to read
PROJ<-gtr_project_extract(url)%>%
  select(-abstract_text)

pander(PROJ[1:3,], split.cell = 80, split.table = Inf)

```


### Individuals
```{r ind_ex,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(GtR)
library(pander)
##Example URL
url<-"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=G0501806"


```


## Impact & Publications
```{r imp,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(GtR)
library(pander)
##Example URL
url<-"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=G0501806"


```
